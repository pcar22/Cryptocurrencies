# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview
We have been given data to work with that is not ideal, so it will need to be processed to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known output for what we are looking for, we will use unsupervised learning. To group the cryptocurrencies, we decided on a clustering algorithm. We will use data visualizations to share our findings.

### Clustering Cryptocurrencies using KMeans
The KMeans algorithm was run to predict the K clusters for the cryptocurrencies data.
